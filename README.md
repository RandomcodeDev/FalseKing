The game is basically about a guy who kills kings with elemental powers to become the False King and take over, which was my friend's idea.

Things likely to be in game:
- 2D graphics with 3D space (so I can just implement drawing textures and pretty much nothing else, and still have it work)
- Maybe random generation, but only enough that it's fun, plus maybe more as NG+ or something, I find some games overdo the randomness
- Skill tree
- Elements: fire, air, water, earth
- Dashing
- Multiple types of attack: normal, special, ranged

C++ syntax is used to represent things that could be done with function pointer tables and preprocessor macros in C, more than OOP (game uses ECS).
